# OPC UA - Android Client
This project has been developed inside the course of Industrial Informatics at University of Catania (DIEEI) teached by Prof. Salvatore Cavalieri.
It is a simple client with a SCADA-style user interface.
This was accomplished by mapping a MonitoredItem with a Scada component including: valves, sensors, pumps and tanks
